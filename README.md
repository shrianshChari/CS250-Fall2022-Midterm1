# CS250-Fall2022-Midterm1

## Archived study guide
Please utilize your efforts with [this guide](https://github.com/theopn/CS250-reviews); we need to unify efforts on one resource.

Oh god why are there 2 midterms in a row

Also, the lecture slides are a monolith holy

### How to help

You should have `pdflatex` installed on your computer (usually you accomplish this by installing `texlive` on your computer).

Then, you can generate the PDF by executing:
```bash
pdflatex review.tex
```

I think you can also go "New Project" => "Import from GitHub" to edit on Overleaf, but you would still have to fork this repository and make pull requests.
